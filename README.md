# iris_detector

Final Project for CS 231n.

## Radius Classifier

This notebook contains the necessary code to construct and train several deep convolutional models to predit the radius of a human iris in a given image.

## Iris Binary Classifier

This notebook implements both a highly accurate iris / not-iris binary classifier and several search algorithms (deterministic grid search, randomized uniform distribution sampling, and randomized gaussian distribution sampling) to determine the most likely iris bounding box.

## Dataset Usage

Note that the dataset used for training and testing was the Miche-I Samsung Galaxy S4 dataset, and the iris / not-iris examples were generated by subsampling images from this dataset.
